Chapter 1

Once upon a time, there were ten different players. They all went through the same training regime before they met each
other in competition. But their personalities differed. Some liked exploring, some liked to stick with what they know.
Some learned fast, some slow. Some had a large brain, some a small. Of some players, thoughts were very deep and
complex, others liked to keep it simple. Some liked looking ahead, some only minded the short term.

Time to introduce our players:
Pietje Puk: Very average guy, with average brain, average learning speed, average exploration, average depth of thought.
            He is the base player, and others like to compare themselves to him. (0.001, 0.98, 0.0001, [50,50])
Liesje Lot: She is a bit more adventurous than Pietje, and likes to explore a bit more. (0.0001, 0.98, 0.0001, [50,50])
Naima Nima: She is a bit more conservative, and likes to go with what she knows. (0.01, 0.98, 0.0001, [50,50])
Samir Smit: He likes to keep things simple and get to the core of it. (0.001, 0.98, 0.0001, [25])
Biesje Bos: She thinks about things quite differently, she sees value in depth. (0.001, 0.98, 0.0001, [50,50,50])
Fatima Flo: Everybody knows her as a quick learner, making steps quickly. (0.001, 0.98, 0.001, [50,50])
Omari Oost: They likes to take their time to learn, but once they knows, they knows. (0.00001, 0.98, 0.0001, [50,50])
Lida Leeuw: She likes to look ahead, and see what the future brings. (0.001, 0.995, 0.0001, [50,50])
Kim Klasen: She likes to live in the moment, and doesn't care about the future. (0.001, 0.95, 0.0001, [50,50])
Diego Delo: He is famous for his very large brain. Does this make him smarter? (0.001, 0.98, 0.0001, [100,100,100])
Randy Rado: He is a bot without a brain, just playing random moves.

Time to introduce our training plan:
* 100.000 games against a random player, with random moves only: learning only afterwards
* 100.000 games against a random player, with learning, shifting epsilon
* 100.000 games against itself, with learning, shifting epsilon

Let's introduce our competition plan:
* 100.000 games against each other without learning (eps=0)
* 100.000 games against each other after learning (eps=0)
